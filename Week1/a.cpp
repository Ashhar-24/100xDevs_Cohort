/*
    To compile this file: g++ a.cpp -o temp, ie changes "a.cpp" file into binary file of the name "temp"
    To run this binary file, use "./temp" on the terminal to get output, if there's no compilation error, the output is displayed
    else not.

    Whereas in JS, the code is not compiled and then executed, it is directly executed and therefore when errors are present
    it is partially executed upto the line of code which is correct.
